1. This team is composed of one team member:
Matthew Polsgrove
NetID: polsgro2

2. The topic that I have selected is creating a Firefox extension to index the current page and allow users to search the page contents with a retrieval function. This is an improvement over current search capabilities, and is related to this course because we have covered text retrieval systems.

3. At minimum, I plan to use the BM25 algorithm. Time permitting, I would like to include the option for other algorithms as well.

4. I will demonstrate successful operation by testing example pages to confirm the algorithm is searching the text as expected.

5. The project will primarily be written in Javascript.

6. This project will involve creating a new browser extension, which will index the page, allow the user to enter a query, and search the page using that query and a retrieval method. I believe that this will meet the 20*N hour requirement with a team size of one.
